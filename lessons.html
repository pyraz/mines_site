							<h2>Statistics With Plinko</h2>

							<p>Here's a lesson plan that demonstrates standard distribustion using the popular "The Price is Right Game" plinko. In plinko, there is a board with a bunch of pegs, and a few collection bins at the bottom. You drop a ball from the top of the board, and it bounces down through the various layers of pins until eventually falling into one of the bins. If you drop all the pins from the top middle of the board, you will most likely get more pins in the middle collection bins. In fact, in theory, the balls would collect perfectly into a standard bell curve. This is because with each pin hit, the ball has a 50/50 chance of going left or right. Since it is more likely it will go left and right the same number of times, thus staying in the middle, than that it will go mostly all left or right, most of the balls will end up in the middle, with fewer on the sides. We built a simple Plinko board for this lesson. I'll try to get some blueprints up on the site, but in the meantime if you have any questions feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>

							<h2>Microbial Transformation</h2>

						<div class="lesson-content">
							<p>This lesson came out of a collaboration with <a href="http://urbanwatererc.org/">ReNUWIt</a>, a group on campus working "Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure". A lot of their work deals with finding new ways to treat waste water to make in drinkable. One of the processes they use is to filter the water through a natural, ground barrier, which is filled with microbes that eat a lot of the pollutants in the water. This lesson plan is designed to teach students the importance and prevalence of microbes in their every days. A lot of students may think of all these microbes as dangerous germs, but in fact very few of the microbes all over our bodies are pathogens. This lesson plan allows students to discover that even though you can't see them, microbes exist all around you in your everyday life. If you have any questions about the lesson plan, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>

							<h2>Cloud in a Bottle</h2>

							<p>Here's a fun experiment I did in my classes to teach students about clouds, and how they're formed. I borrowed this one from <a href="http://inside.mines.edu/~jschneid/">Joseph Schneiderwind</a>, a fellow in the program last year. Clouds are formed from water evaporating up into the sky, where there is lower pressure. The experiment works by putting water in a 2 liter bottle and then pumping it full of air. This creates a lot of air pressure in the bottle. When you release the cork, the air rushes out, creating low pressure in the bottle, and the water turns into a cloud. The experiment actually works a little better with isopropric alchol instead of water, but the principle is exactly the same.</p>
